Task 1

Build a vagrantfile that create a virtualbox VM (centos 7.x) with the latest version of docker and docker-compose
 
create a docker image (using a dockerfile) with nginx latest open source version
 
run the nginx docker container as a systemctl process on the virtualbox, and expose the port 80 from virtual guest to local host OS on port 80.
 
-create below entries on the hosts file where the browser (host system) is running
 myfirstpage.com  127.0.0.1
mysecondpage.com  127.0.0.1
mythirdpage.com 127.0.0.1
 
 
the nginx should serve 3 html files, reasonably designed , with varying content.
  - 1.html
  - 2.html
  - 3.html
 
127.0.0.1/1.html should service 1.html
127.0.0.1/2.html should service 2.html
127.0.0.1/3.html should service 3.html
 
myfirstpage.com should only serve 1.html
mysecondpage.com should only serve 2.html
mythirdpage.com should only serve 3.html
